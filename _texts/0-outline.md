WWII, the U.N., and the UDHR; Civil and Political Rights.

If you believe in human rights then the power of state sovereignty can never be absolute over the rights of individual humans. Even when the sovereignty of the state comes from the will of the people. There are rights of individuals, and of communities, and the international community says that there are other ways - other than the state intervening with its sovereignty - to protect these rights (160).

There are some arguments about treaty law (after Albanian case re right to educations). Different treaties between different peoples. Treaties between private parties tangentially which will affect states (states are private parties). Treaties of friendship and commerce (we had a treaty of friendship and commerce with Iran) which ensure that one nation won’t meddle with the internal affairs of the other state.

One of the problems for the U.S. had in ratifying the genocide convention was that the U.S. was in breach because the U.S. signed in 1952 and ratified in 1986 and at the time it signed was committing genocide against African American people, against Latino people, definitely against Native American people. Other signatories to a convention per some document can call out other signatories to the convention if they find they are violating the convention.

**Hate speech:** ICCPR has clause that does not allow hate speech. The U.S. reservation allows for hate speech in a way that the ICCPR does not allow for that reservation. But body says we want U.S. to be a party to this, so we have to grant them a reservation which allows them to interpret hate speech the way they do.

**Vienna convention:** U.S. views it as customary law that is binding but since U.S. has not ratified, U.S. says it is binding because customary law, so why should they sign. The parts of the treaties that they may be said to breach, they say no no that part of the treaty is not customary law what are you talking about.

We looked at after ww1. Now we will look at Nuremberg trials after ww2, at the establishment of the United Nations. Note that starts with a group called the United Nations against the axis powers. Then they decided to be the United Nations.

Not clear where we should focus on groups of people to speak through their states where states are huge like china and India, or small like Lichtenstein and Monaco. Should these people have more to say regarding rights for populations?

## Crimes against peace

**Jus ad bellum** establishes the right to go to war (goes back to Christianity, Judaism, says this is when it is appropriate to go to war, this is when not). That gets reduced into treaties in 1867-68, and again in late 19th century early 20th century Hague convention, Geneva convention; what you can do as part of the fighting.

**Jus in bello**

**numen crimen sine legum:** In U.S. no post facto law. Kaiser wilhelm after ww1: it would be post facto law to say aggression was illegal. However, after ww1 treaty of Paris. And other treaties. Germany signed on.

It was agreeed that law as matter of national policy was illegal. (P. 124). If you set up a distinct court Russia is guilty of crime against Ukraine. Discussion of war crimes. Discussion of crimes against humanity. Should we be able to try a nation within its state for actions performed before the war.

Crimes against humanity: persecution of Jews. Should another tribunal have jurisdiction over this or should these crimes be charged in Germany?

Final solution. 1941. This was connected to war and civilian populations in Europe. However, what Germans did to Jews before war, alongside war, were not illegal in Germany.

If we create something that can charge you, that can punish you, this might be problematic.

Tyre Nichols. The international community should come in and speak. We will talk about the reporting mechanisms that document violations of human rights.

I do worry about… I would be in favor of a more stringent outcome in this circumstance. Just a few weeks ago there was some talk between Poland and Germany about reparations that might be made - and Germany said no there were treaties signed after the war. Germany during the war said “we’re going to reduce you to a colony” which brings up colonialism. Now saying no no no more reparations. If we are saying we can try a nation on what it did… this is problematic

Retroactive responsibility for things that have been illegal throughout (people knew it was wrong and not allowed to behave in that way but knew they would not be penalized for that) but there was no punishment established, no court to try them in, whether the actors who were aware of the violative nature of their acts - they knew that their behavior violated some custom - you knew at the time that what you were doing was wrong and you sapped our countries of resources for hundreds of years - whether we should hold ourselves to what the state is bound. Increasingly, we are seeing that the international community is pulling back state sovereignty when the state has committed crimes against its subjects. Court trying former Yugoslavia. Does it have to be tied to a war? No. This is why we have a security council at the u.n..

Two ways: one, there was always a human connection that people cared about. Look at peace agreements in for example India from 2000 years ago where that was terrible we mustn’t let it happen again. Two. What is enforceable and in the interest of the international community to enforce. Because of different kinds of treatments, always easier for security council to step in when economic interests at stake.

### UDHR and bill of international Rights

There are some challenges to the universality of the initial program. Challenges to the question of who was at the table, and whether they went to the right schools. Even if you are stepping up for a dignitarian view, you are getting a dignitarian view inflected by Eaton, inflected by Harvard. So you are not getting a universal declaration. What do you think about UDHR being a declaration? Not a treaty. A treaty would bind states. UDHR more normative. Aspirational, hortatory. Technically, the UDHR is a United Nations resolution. You can call a resolution a declaration, … Article 10. Article 13. UDHR has a moral authority, not a binding legal authority.

## International covenants

The international covenants are distinct. As opposed to a mandate to a body that can give advice on how things should be progressing and reflects the views of many different issues, the ICCPR is binding - brings obligations; challenges would come from your own nationals; people within your country.

Mary Ann Glendon (p. 146) responding to Makua Mutua (p.149) saying that there is universality (Makua Mutua said no universality).

Charity’s own frustration with moral authority not becoming legally binding. Moral comes from Latin mos, mores, which means custom. So moral law is customary. You have to ask whether a moral obligation becomes a legal obligation.

I want to go to this question again of civil and political rights. Some discussion about Vienna in 1993. A recognition at a conference that human rights are universal, inalienable, interdependent and interconnected. You need them all to support a system. You need political rights but you also need some economic supports for individuals. We see creation of any number of mechanisms where laws are developing. For example, post ww2 the genocide convention; we also get the covenant on social and economic rights. We have to ask ourselves how enforceable is this.

**Jus cogens** are peremptory norms. You can’t create a law that violates a peremptory norm. Antonio Cassese is saying that there are fundamental norms from which we may not deviate. So we may recognize that there are fundamental values in the international legal system.

Geneva convention says that these are non-derogatory.

Slavery. We recognize that it is something that cannot or should not exist. But we know that some people are trafficked for work. U.S. has signed on to sex trafficking treaties but not to treaties for protecting migrant workers. A case that the U.S. decided in 2021 that nestle went to Ivory Coast, saw children working, spreading chemicals so that cocoa plantations can grow. These children not living with families, not getting education. Families paid some money to go work on … and they can’t leave. U.S. said that this is not a lawsuit you can bring because us has treaty with Ivory Coast for importing chocolate. Ten year old, twelve year olds cannot choose not to work when they have been transported from their homes.
