## WWII, the U.N., and the UDHR. Civil and Political Rights.

2023-01-31 Assignment Three pp. 120-154, 157-86.

If you believe in human rights then the power of state sovereignty can never be absolute over the rights of individual humans. Even when the sovereignty of the state comes from the will of the people. There are rights of individuals, and of communities, and the international community says that there are other ways - other than the state intervening with its sovereignty - to protect these rights (160).

There are some arguments about treaty law (after Albanian case re right to educations). Different treaties between different peoples. Treaties between private parties tangentially which will affect states (states are private parties). Treaties of friendship and commerce (we had a treaty of friendship and commerce with Iran) which ensure that one nation won’t meddle with the internal affairs of the other state.

One of the problems for the U.S. had in ratifying the genocide convention was that the U.S. was in breach because the U.S. signed in 1952 and ratified in 1986 and at the time it signed was committing genocide against African American people, against Latino people, definitely against Native American people. Other signatories to a convention per some document can call out other signatories to the convention if they find they are violating the convention.

**Hate speech:** ICCPR has clause that does not allow hate speech. The U.S. reservation allows for hate speech in a way that the ICCPR does not allow for that reservation. But body says we want U.S. to be a party to this, so we have to grant them a reservation which allows them to interpret hate speech the way they do.

**Vienna convention:** U.S. views it as customary law that is binding but since U.S. has not ratified, U.S. says it is binding because customary law, so why should they sign. The parts of the treaties that they may be said to breach, they say no no that part of the treaty is not customary law what are you talking about.

We looked at after ww1. Now we will look at Nuremberg trials after ww2, at the establishment of the United Nations. Note that starts with a group called the United Nations against the axis powers. Then they decided to be the United Nations.

Not clear where we should focus on groups of people to speak through their states where states are huge like china and India, or small like Lichtenstein and Monaco. Should these people have more to say regarding rights for populations?

### Crimes against peace

**Jus ad bellum** establishes the right to go to war (goes back to Christianity, Judaism, says this is when it is appropriate to go to war, this is when not). That gets reduced into treaties in 1867-68, and again in late 19th century early 20th century Hague convention, Geneva convention; what you can do as part of the fighting.

**Jus in bello**

**numen crimen sine legum:** In U.S. no post facto law. Kaiser wilhelm after ww1: it would be post facto law to say aggression was illegal. However, after ww1 treaty of Paris. And other treaties. Germany signed on.

It was agreeed that law as matter of national policy was illegal. (P. 124). If you set up a distinct court Russia is guilty of crime against Ukraine. Discussion of war crimes. Discussion of crimes against humanity. Should we be able to try a nation within its state for actions performed before the war.

Crimes against humanity: persecution of Jews. Should another tribunal have jurisdiction over this or should these crimes be charged in Germany?

Final solution. 1941. This was connected to war and civilian populations in Europe. However, what Germans did to Jews before war, alongside war, were not illegal in Germany.

If we create something that can charge you, that can punish you, this might be problematic.

Tyre Nichols. The international community should come in and speak. We will talk about the reporting mechanisms that document violations of human rights.

I do worry about… I would be in favor of a more stringent outcome in this circumstance. Just a few weeks ago there was some talk between Poland and Germany about reparations that might be made - and Germany said no there were treaties signed after the war. Germany during the war said “we’re going to reduce you to a colony” which brings up colonialism. Now saying no no no more reparations. If we are saying we can try a nation on what it did… this is problematic

Retroactive responsibility for things that have been illegal throughout (people knew it was wrong and not allowed to behave in that way but knew they would not be penalized for that) but there was no punishment established, no court to try them in, whether the actors who were aware of the violative nature of their acts - they knew that their behavior violated some custom - you knew at the time that what you were doing was wrong and you sapped our countries of resources for hundreds of years - whether we should hold ourselves to what the state is bound. Increasingly, we are seeing that the international community is pulling back state sovereignty when the state has committed crimes against its subjects. Court trying former Yugoslavia. Does it have to be tied to a war? No. This is why we have a security council at the u.n..

Two ways: one, there was always a human connection that people cared about. Look at peace agreements in for example India from 2000 years ago where that was terrible we mustn’t let it happen again. Two. What is enforceable and in the interest of the international community to enforce. Because of different kinds of treatments, always easier for security council to step in when economic interests at stake.

### UDHR and bill of international Rights

There are some challenges to the universality of the initial program. Challenges to the question of who was at the table, and whether they went to the right schools. Even if you are stepping up for a dignitarian view, you are getting a dignitarian view inflected by Eaton, inflected by Harvard. So you are not getting a universal declaration. What do you think about UDHR being a declaration? Not a treaty. A treaty would bind states. UDHR more normative. Aspirational, hortatory. Technically, the UDHR is a United Nations resolution. You can call a resolution a declaration, … Article 10. Article 13. UDHR has a moral authority, not a binding legal authority.

### International covenants

The international covenants are distinct. As opposed to a mandate to a body that can give advice on how things should be progressing and reflects the views of many different issues, the ICCPR is binding - brings obligations; challenges would come from your own nationals; people within your country.

Mary Ann Glendon (p. 146) responding to Makua Mutua (p.149) saying that there is universality (Makua Mutua said no universality).

Charity’s own frustration with moral authority not becoming legally binding. Moral comes from Latin mos, mores, which means custom. So moral law is customary. You have to ask whether a moral obligation becomes a legal obligation.

I want to go to this question again of civil and political rights. Some discussion about Vienna in 1993. A recognition at a conference that human rights are universal, inalienable, interdependent and interconnected. You need them all to support a system. You need political rights but you also need some economic supports for individuals. We see creation of any number of mechanisms where laws are developing. For example, post ww2 the genocide convention; we also get the covenant on social and economic rights. We have to ask ourselves how enforceable is this.

**Jus cogens** are peremptory norms. You can’t create a law that violates a peremptory norm. Antonio Cassese is saying that there are fundamental norms from which we may not deviate. So we may recognize that there are fundamental values in the international legal system.

Geneva convention says that these are non-derogatory.

Slavery. We recognize that it is something that cannot or should not exist. But we know that some people are trafficked for work. U.S. has signed on to sex trafficking treaties but not to treaties for protecting migrant workers. A case that the U.S. decided in 2021 that nestle went to Ivory Coast, saw children working, spreading chemicals so that cocoa plantations can grow. These children not living with families, not getting education. Families paid some money to go work on … and they can’t leave. U.S. said that this is not a lawsuit you can bring because us has treaty with Ivory Coast for importing chocolate. Ten year old, twelve year olds cannot choose not to work when they have been transported from their homes.

## Civil and Political Rights

2023-02-07 Assignment Four pp. 186-220, 220-276. This class fishbowl pages circa 162 (CEDAW) - 219
Next class pp 220-274. CEDAW

We’re going to look at some of the rights that come up with the treaty

- Disparate treatment
- How states protect rights of individuals
- Reasons for protection of rights of women
- Uses of CEDAW

CEDAW reporting mechanism (one thing you can do with these reporting mechanisms is have reports made to CEDAW committee, who will then make reports to the state, recommending action [you are not in compliance with CEDAW and this is what you can do to be in compliance]). The way you can get the compliance mechanism is by an optional part of the treaty that a state agrees to.

Why would a state be as honest as Guatemala in its report about how it had failed to respect rights of women? Most states are very careful. However, they can’t control civilian community.

Guatemala was maybe genuinely interested in improving the condition of women in Guatemala. The report highlights problems with patriarchy.

Maybe Guatemala was responding to pressure

A lot of this is based on stereotype. It’s based on expectations of the roles of men and women, in a way that usually disempowers women.

Is there a reason that the world bank does not have a dignitarian view but instead makes an economic argument. (173)

What these treaties can do:

Negative rights - positive rights. Silly distinction.

Negative rights means that the status quo be maintained. To say that the right to vote is a negative right doesn’t mean that the government can not think about it. The government has a duty to ensure that citizens can vote in such a way that there vote is effective. It can be said that the government has a duty …

1. Respect rights of others
2. Create institutional machinery to realization of rights
3. Protect rights/prevent violations
4. Provide goods and services to satisfy rights
5. Promote rights (educate people about rights so that these rights become self-enforcing)

The trump administration was trying to get local law enforcement to be a force multiplier in immigration systems - created a system where if you agreed to help homeland security you would get benefits - Amherst MA chose not to help but instead to be an asylum community. The trump administration made it look like law enforcement had to cooperate - that they had an obligation. This is the opposite of the government educating people about their rights; this was the government giving false information to further its political projects.

CEDAW should require us to act on, for example, the problem of boys being encouraged to study math and women encouraged to do writing instead of math. If the government has an obligation to promos the rights it should promote equality here.

Page 34 et sequitur of supplemental readings.

CEDAW is progressive in the sense that it is requiring that there be steps taken.

The choice of the word “ensure” is huge.

What does notice look like. Education. Laws. Intervention: customary law, religious law. As a starting point to change societal norms.

- A country can sign but not ratify a convention/treaty
- Optional reporting protocol
- A country can sign on or not sign on to the optional reporting protocol (this optional protocol allows CEDAW to investigate alleged violations and issue reports and recommendations for remedying the problem)
- A country can have its own reporting mechanisms and then report to the committee (here, the CEDAW committee)  

The u.s. has signed on to a few treaties and there is a reporting cycle where we report every few years on the progress we have made, on, for example, torture or discrimination on the basis of race. Very different reports under Obama and trump administrations.

Velazquez-Rodriguez case. Honduras says we were not responsible for this person going missing. People go missing. Honduras may have been involved or may not, but if you have an obligation to ensure that people are not disappeared and tortured the state must put in place laws and policies and enforce these so as to allow for protection of certain rights.

CEDAW commission found that although Honduras had useful laws, it did not enforce them.

P. 205 - Hungary case. Should CEDAW concern itself with a very local issue, that concerns one family where the father abuses the mother and threatens to rape one of the children who has developmental needs.

Even though this is one family, this could happen to another family. If the state does not do anything about it, it is condoning it, it is saying that this is okay and is customary. It becomes part of customary law.

The idea of a due diligence standard is a Trojan horse. If you say Mexico has to ensure that people are not disappeared and Hungary has to provide adequate housing for families with disabled children to not have to stay in abusive dangerous situation.

Looking at due diligence really seems to allow for a disparate impact test. If something has the effect of impairing the enjoyment of women in… see 34 et sequitur

Idea of creating quotas - the idea of modeling what our societies should do. Problematic.

## CEDAW

2023-02-14

Peru. We get a CEDAW report of someone who has been raped, attempting suicide, and when she needs to have surgery done they’re concerned about the effect it might have on a foetus .

So violates even law under Peru at the time.

This is very local. One person’s rights to have surgery to protect their health. If preventing this surgery to save foetus then dehumanizing person to some extent.

This is discrimination based on sex.

Professor distinguishing between sex and gender. Gender being a construct attached to a person’s identity and sex based on physical characteristics.

Sexual orientation and gender identity issues have focused on punishments and violent crimes against persons based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We saw un pass a resolution in 2016 - some of you might have experience here in one of our gender justice clinics of actions based on ICC - not focused on going up against US or other great powers in the ICC - some time spent investigating British experience in Iraq and some time investigating situation in Israel. I expect prosecutor will step on …

I can help with war crimes and crimes against humanity which are focused on gender identity - so some of the treaties that were written 30 years ago can be understood differently because the ICC is interpreting them differently.

When we talk about punishments we’re talking about prohibitions on extrajudicial executions and other crimes against humanity

When we’re talking about sexual orientation and gender identity and race. Is it proper to say that there is consensus on sex and race but no consensus on sexual identity and gender issues.

The current pope is taking a slightly different stance, but while the catechism continues to say that same-sex actions are sinful but same-sex attractions are not sinful because people are who they are and love who they love.

The holy seat is a weird little place. Maybe 800 people. In terms of the global level of influence we see colonialism raising its ugly head - we see the laws in those countries which were instated by colonials, but see that now being pushed back against prohibitions of these laws by anti-colonials.

Some people’s lives are put in danger by prohibitions on …

We’re saying that people have a right to have the state protect them from being harmed because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Someone said we don’t want to make social norms binding on countries. What does this mean in the creation and enforcement of human rights law.

As a starting point human rights are indivisible. Thus over your intersectionality you have treaties and covenants that protect overarching rights.

However if we go back to Hobbes we see the concept of brutes - brutality means that person being brutalized is being treated like a brute, a person who is too much like an animal, too ignorant to understand law.

See questions on page 237

Asylum cases should be able to be made for people who need protection because discrimination and danger

If it is a question of behavior rather than identity this should be left up to the state. This is a dehumanizing argument. Just like criminality, the state has some involvement in managing behavior of individuals who have a choice.

If we are looking at characteristics that are impermeable, that are immutable. So love and attraction is a component of where we stand in the world and we don’t have full control of that, so we don’t have a choice.

Should states only have to yield to a scientific definition that helps figure out what the immutable part of the self is?

If we start off with the premise that human rights is natural law - that there are some rights that are inherent in human beings; that the law does not define rights but the rights define the law. This is monist view. Everyone is dignified and deserves the law.

The dualist view that the u.s. ascribes o is that there are rights only when agreed upon. Only the states can agree on what rights people should have.

So if there is a time where parts of populations were transferred without their consent - where children were moved and they and their parents were enslaved.

If the logic is that the individuals don’t feel pain the same way other people feel pain, that they don’t …

The question here is are we going to impose on states a new-colonial view that behavior should be allowed that is prohibited in former colonies.

So some people are saying that you can’t change the laws in my country ….

If you are saying that laws are illegitimate, the illegitimacy of the laws cannot be based on the way they were elected. If you are saying not free to make those choices you are saying that there is a standard above and beyond the legitimated voice of the representative of a people.

Robert: categorizing behavior versus identity, I do not agree that this can be scientifically determined.

In international law there is an ongoing argument about whether people who are economic refugees and climate refugees. This is based on the idea that there is a state somewhere that has an obligation to protect those rights. The protecting state in order to protect you has to first define what state had that obligation and if the person seeking refuge had the ability of seeing protection in that state. If we can show that the person had no protections in that state.

The scientific immaleability - you are who you are - so we have to have some kind of protection of who you are.

If we are going to expand our views of treatment - how much can we say is core to our human condition.

Bentham on torture. Torture is better than being convicted of the crime because you use the acute version of the punishment you would give them anyway.

Bentham assumes that anything you can do as torture is also something that is permissible as punishment for a crime.

This came up in the early Obama investigation when person Oliver brought back from Iraq and considered a threat to the USA - when treated as a suspect he fled to Yemen with his son and said the United States should be attached. The Obama administration did a drone strike killing him and his son who was 15 at the time. CIA people said that there is no transparency - we are trying to adhere to the constitution where we are truing to …

It should not be there someone who is …

We should only …

Only can use punishments in use in torture. So if Bentham could use the rack, because that was punishment in England at the time, we can only use incarceration.

You have to apply the same standard as for conviction. If we have for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, then for torture the standard must be we know you have the information we want beyond a reasonable doubt.

Charity does not want to skip the Israeli case.

Israeli case: we’re not sure if this is torture but can we give deference to the Israeli intelligence services? Court says no.

Second question is is this torture? Chair, leaning over, body weight, is this torture? Court says yes.

Third question: but we’re going to save thousands of lives. Court says yes that is an affirmative defense. If you prove your case you will not have tortured because that was justified. If you don’t prove your case you will have engaged in torture and that is a crime.

U.s. we recognized that Syria had jurisdiction over some people u.s. deported to Syria knowing people would be tortured.

We see also in u.k. What can be done for protection of nation and what can be used in courts. Answer is we cannot use that in court systems.

We get some arguments made about when torture is permissible and under what circumstances and what protections should be given.

One of the beauties of taking a class that has this comparative instrument you are allowed to have someone who is arguing for the public interest and you don’t need an individual who was harmed. Here we need an active case and controversy and we need you to show you were harmed in order for you to bring your case.

International covenant on civil and political rights says that there are some things you may not do. Torture is one of them. Not in time of war, not in any circumstances. U.s. tries to redefine torture after September 11.

Bentham’s analysis would still hold under the u.s. torture convention. Any inhumane treatment is not allowed. But in u.s. “severe” treatment can be understood as something that would cause organ failure or death. If that is the case then you have engaged in torture. For example, you can knead someone in the thigh you can cause internal bleeding, but it heals the next day. Then you can do it again. Taxi driver and dark something. They didn’t keep good records of how much they had kneaded his thigh, so they believed that they were not engaging in anything that was severe enough to cause organ failure or death. Here there is no intent to kill but intent to torture.

There is no right without a remedy. So if you have someone on your territory who committed torture, under the convention you have to extradite them to another state for trial and punishment.

A friend of his Claudia grossman was rapporteur on torture at u.n.

## Economic and Social Rights

Assignment Five pp. 277-330. distinctions based in religion, resources, and the interrelated nature of rights.

2023-02-28 human rights law

Economic and social rights. Rights to unionize, rights to fair wages. Interest-convergence theory - state trying to respond to certain threats - here Bolshevism and communism - trying to ensure labor rights while responding to potential threat of governments being overturned by Bolshevist or communist labor movements. Governments trying to protect the right to work.

In third term of Roosevelt talking about being free not just from war but being free also from want. Roosevelt lists all these things that every family should have. Decent home. Food. Business free from unfair competition. There’s are not civil and political rights. These are economic and social rights.

As we look at the international covenant of social and economic rights

We see in article 2 - take advantage of its own resources 6to the maximum ability of its resources. How is that different from a guarantee of a right to vote. Charity thinks not that different. Some of the writers will say that the progressive element makes it different from other rights.

In the first instance what might that progressive element look like. When were talking about developing countries are we talking about countries that are free to develop the progression of these rights. Or are they …

Marti Essen - development as freedom. Argument that you cannot have development if you don’t have freedom to exercise human dignity.

Let’s start with a human dignity right.

Stopping people from having access to water shows a lack of respect for that part of the population.

When you do have resources, to whom are those resources allocated and in what way.

Examples of allocation of water. East Palestine. Chemical spill. Reason why chemical spill is because we have mechanisms by which we transport chemicals. We are subsidizing these mechanisms and we are trying to keep it cheap to be competitive globally. We shield train companies from liability so that they can transport things more cheaply. Water is not accessed because …
Another example is if you are in Georgia and you’re waiting in line to vote and someone brings you water and you want to stay in line and that is criminalized in Georgia to the point that you can be taken off the line to vote. This criminalization allows you to have some cultural and social …

Argument is that bringing something to people who need something comes at a cost. Making sure there is water for everyone you need to have aquifers and clean water for bathing.

Canada says what do we have to do to ensure that everyone has wearers.

Important for us as lawyers to say that I don’t care who you are but I’m going to challenge what you are saying … because I am concerned and want to understand your reasoning.

Idea of self determination is if we are self protected as a state that puts us in a good place.

Populist majority can take resources away from other groups

Welfare state. Should we be making sure there is a minimum protection for people in our societies.

Kant: love is good
Right to respect leave my stuff alone

What does compulsory education look like looking back to the case of Greeks in Albania. We want everyone to be educated but not in Greek

We will continue up to page 382 for next class.

## Approaches to economic and social rights

2023-03-14 Assignment Six pp. 330-82. Approaches to economic and social rights recognized by constitutions, courts, and administrative bodies.

Human rights prioritizing the enlightenment perspective

In the past a jury of our peers was the idea of other lords in the House of Lords being able to stand up to the king.

African scholar says western framework of human rights is skewed.

There are divisive issues. Divisive doesn’t mean that telling the party on the other side that you’re so so wrong.

Gov of South Africa v grootboom p 358

Gov has a responsibility to improve social and economic rights. But taking time. Court says gov has to move more quickly. Apartheid left many people at a great disadvantage. So we see courts speaking up to South African gov saying you didn’t do what you said you were going to do.

Page 363 - courts say gov has to create programme and programme has to provide reasonable measures to provide …. Stuff

Gov can prioritize, for example, saving lots of people with dialysis at the expense of treating people like person in other case with chronic kidney disease. But gov has to demonstrate a rational basis for decision.

HIV transmitted at birth. Concertos is lack of efficacy over time. You don’t know long term effects, but you know short term effects. If not treated many of those kids are going to die.

Mazibuko v city of Johannesburg p 369

Program failing because people didn’t sign up for program. Government didn’t promote well. Did gov fail to provide water when it didn’t promote?

Idea of kicking it back to the legislature when the legislature has its own plan

We kind of skipped over education rights in us. We noted that brown v board showed that segregation should be ended in public school system. We go into what does that mean and what is the basis for adequate education -

If we’re going to say there’s a minimum core of rights to education (right to civic participation, etc)

What we’re seeing is the right to education in article 13 of the international covenant on human rights

This is why United States does not ratify treaties. It says that because there are so many states. We allow each state to determine what an educated person should know.

Should you recognize that power wants to limit what people can do and human rights are a way to protect people from the power that wants to limit them.

Power has always seen that power is maintained by redistributing resources to people who will keep them in power.

So all this language where we see that all people have a right to self determination, that is not clear.

The right to self determination brings up this question of what should it mean for a human rights mechanism to protect the individual form the larger power structures. Part of that is self determination but you can’t discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, language, ethnicity.

We talked about the Albanians who were Muslim who said as long as you have money you can create schools. It is ….

This brings us to the question of protecting people in national security. We start with what the state is, and for some people this is the nation-state.

Does not make people in a nation more secure to say that we are going to violate rights of people around the world

Page 24 of the supplement: limiting clauses - only to such limitations as are allowed by law and only for the purpose of promoting the general rights in a community.

The iccpr takes it a little further. Articles 2 and 4 - everyone should be protected in the same way with these rights. Article 4 has a limiting principle: the right to derogate. In times of public emergency … states may take measures derogations … acc the exigencies of the situation, and do not involve discrimination on the grounds of race, ….

Even within that right to derogate, there are limitations. For example, right to life, right to be free from torture, from slavery,

When you have a nation state, what does it mean not to discriminate on the basis of language, nationality. Because that we are defining ourselves as a nation on the basis of nationality, language. Here in the us we are defining rights …

There was some hope that the trump administration was going to support the pkk (Kurds) - what do we do with the Tamil liberation tigers.

So the question is how do we define terrorism and how do we define national security

We shift from national security … we

How do we define terrorism. Three concepts:
1. Borrow from the threat of something like September 11 and go after groups who are not popular in your country to begin with. Chile 1973. If you haven’t done anything then
2. People who are marginalized against government. Government not terrorist; government has police power
3. Law of armed conflict. We made up this concept where in order to be protected by the Geneva Convention you have to be a country. So they don’t get prisoner of war protection. Geneva Convention says different laws apply to combatants who wear uniform and flag of a nation. One of the problem of a “war on terror” is that combatants are outside of that conflict. So what rights do apply?

The uk creates a de-radicalization

2011-2012 period - number of states where people rise up - is there a point where we can say that the government no longer is a state because no longer represents the people. By saying they would carpet bomb trump was stepping away from a human rights framework and entering a use of force framework.

Readings for today were up to 445. Read up to 485 for next class.

Bigger chunk to go through for class.

## National Security, Terrorism, and the Law of Armed Conflict

2023-03-28 Assignment Seven pp. 383-445. .

Lex specialist that derogates from more general law. Some will argue that the more special law is different from other law because it limits the right to life. The argument is that the most special law would be the international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict. Others have noted that there isn’t necessarily a conflict between the two. Law of armed conflict tries to mitigate the effects of armed conflict.

**Humanitarian law:** Article 4 of international covenant on civil and political rights says

- Has to be proportional to threat
- You have to announce the threat
- Does not allow for derogation from right to life
- Right to be free from torture
- No ex post facto law
- Can’t have personhood taken away - article 15
- Freedom of thought - religion -article 16 (free to practice religion)

This came up in the context of derogations by us and uk after September 11. Particularly when we look at rights of persons in the state but have citizenship elsewhere, are in the state but do not reside in the state.

National security. The shift that has occurred in recent years regarding the treatment of migrants. Treaty between us and Mexico, between us and Guatemala, which say us can deport people to those countries to have their cases heard there. This was not immediately clear under international law whether you have a right to remain there or if the country can send you somewhere else so long as there is not a risk for that person’s safety there. Is there a difference between sending them somewhere where they don’t know anyone or sending them somewhere they are at danger.

In theory you could argue that you don’t need a derogation clause or an emergency clause because you can always balance rights. We will talk about this in context of right to water and right to food in the context of armed conflict.

Guantanamo Bay - back and forth between various commissions and us government - people still locked up there today

Charity remembers gulag - Soviet Union - where people are locked up with no trial for indefinite periods of time. Charity thought that this did not happen in us. Now realizes that it does.

Boumedienne v bush - the Supreme Court found that the lack of habeas corpus - the holding someone without saying why or where they’re held strips them of all rights -

People still being held at Guantanamo are not being released to us territory or us continent

Page 434 a and others v United Kingdom

European court of human rights

Can you consider when September 11 happened in the us, a state of emergency in the uk? Can you use an immigration measure to deal with the problem?

When we talk about immigration measures to deal with the problem were talking about deportation on the basis of moral turpitude which allow us to deport them and not allow them back for ten years. If we think someone is a threat but are not sure, can we use immigration law to exclude them from the us.

Extraordinary rendition - in the us we have a practice that - if you have dual citizenship you can send the person to the other country - to pose questions - we don’t do this to us nationals, so they would have to have another nationality to do this. The us and the uk found ways to strip them of their nationality so that if we put them in a compound where we don’t want Americans killed. So you strip them of their nationality the day before and then the next day attack the compound and say there was no loss of American life.

In a and others v United Kingdom, we have the uk concerned about national security. We find that we can’t have something that’s overinclusive and under inclusive. We’re detaining people not uk nationals but not detaining uk nationals who are posing a greater threat. You have a detention stat dated that is saying that if not a citizen we are going to detain you differently.

Margin of appreciation: European court of human rights realizes that it must give large margin of appreciation for decisions made by other countries.

Uk treatment of non-nationals in detaining them.

There wasn’t sufficient clear explanation of why persons would be a threat to the life of the nation of the United Kingdom .

Iccpr - you have to explain the threat and act proportionately

The question here is where is the theater of war Is.

Proportionality question. How definitive the public emergency threatening the life of the nation needs to be.

Threat of imminent attack
Was the nation already attacked

They collected information and deduced that there was a threat - they don’t have to say why there was a threat - the House of Lords found that the derogation measures were disproportionate; you didn’t have to treat uk citizens differently from non uk citizens.

Questions on page 443

Page 464 question 2 - diplomatic assurances (fear of torture concerns)

We have guarantees that the government of the place we are deporting you to has protections in place, will protect you. We are not going to send you to the place where people are waiting to harm you. Can we send you to the place where the government says they give diplomatic assurances that the person will not be harmed?

What is the level of disbelief. If a country is saying that they are going to respect this person’s human rights, do they have the enforcement mechanism to ensure that the persons human rights will be protected?

We are not in violation of our obligation because by our laws we can deport them. We are not going to deport them to Jordan because they will be in danger in Jordan. We will deport them to a country that gives diplomatic assurances that they will protect the person. We will no longer be responsible for this person’s safety.

Pages 459-460: things a government has to look at before entering into an agreement to deport people.

The mou has a more robust assurances than if there weren’t an mou

We have to trust in some system

The British are trusting in the Jordanian government

The international community has to say that’s a reasonable system

Pages 469-470

If you are accused of going against the state, is it ever going to be fair for you to be tried by a military court.

Military tribunals that are looking at people who are accused of terrorism - we have officers in the military who are believing that those people should never be set free.

The only courts that should be looking at your issues is an independent already existing court.
 (What does it mean to threaten the life of the nation - we wont look at that now - have to define nation)

## Duty-based social orders. Challenges to universalism.

2023-04-04 Assignment Nine pp. 509-82.

Chapter 6 trying to determine what it would mean to have inalienable rights. The Vienna convention specifically speaks about inalienable rights.

Suppose there is a social contract.

You might decide you want to have nobility; pure democracy; one of those things but protection for some groups within that state; what about if there are other things you don’t agree on but what are not contemplated in social contract.

If there are rules saying who you can hang out with and cannot hang out with, are these fundamental rights. Do these rights preexist and supersede societal determinations.

As we create a sense of community, as we create rules to plan the community. A planned community, a religious community. We create rules.

Rhode Island baby Jesus display. As a taxpayer I don’t want my money to go towards Christian messaging. However, congress said Christmas has a religious component.  

Article 20 of iccpr says you cannot incite discrimination (article against hate speech). We are not going to stop people from using hateful speech. Not going to stop them from associating to share hateful speech.

Pages 504-506 David kennedy, looking at emancipatory value of human rights.

United States has said that people have spoken, people have protested even in ways that are not allowed by us law or international law.

Libya. Protests against khaddafi . Khaddaffi was elected. Should we see election as a will of the people. Should people be able to protest?

When in Kiev in 2010 or so people raided an armory and marched on the capitol we called it a revolution. Should we support the people who want to align with the west, who don’t want to be part of Russia?

Finland just joined nato. Is this a good thing? Yes.

So if someone has overturned democracy in order to align more closely with what we view as more democratic values, or economic choices through capital, is it right to support those individuals when they have overturned their country?

Human rights regime requires us to take a loss. We go into that we have to recognize decisions made by people according to rules. When system doesn’t work at all then yes, we can recognize revolutionaries.

A right to the ideal of democracy people should maybe not have that right.

Responsibility as opposed to rights: pp 513-514. Gikuyu people have responsibility to care for parents. To care for community. Individualism is frowned upon. We stay in same place we were born generation after generation after generation.

Some countries have personal law. Different religious communities follow different religious laws. The state recognizes a family’s personal law that comes from the community to which they belong. We look at provisions to national constitutions. Page 517.

Uganda constitution on page 117: problem with provision that is very broad - such as a duty to foster national unity and live in harmony with others - is that I don’t know what harmony means in this context.

Page 518 (we skipped this in class discussion but it was reading): we all know Africa is a vast continent with many different perspectives - so to speak about African values is to devalue the many perspectives and set up the dichotomy from colonialism where there is an idea of what are developed and undeveloped countries.

Page 524. We should not work against ourselves o the benefit of an outside state. Therefore we don’t know if we are promoting individual’s rights.

Robert not necessarily opposed to the idea of collective rights. For example, climate change. We should do that together but not at the expense of violating individual freedoms. Group morality - this is the agreed upon morality of a group.

Steiner 525 to 529 - group identity can exist but groups can struggle for power and survival.

Primacy of determination of group identity - what does the right actually mean. Native tribes inviting African Americans to join their tribe so that land can be protected from resale.

The whole process of colonization and decolonization has created boundaries for a lot of people that are awful.

In contrast to Europe where, for example, the Belgians. Where you had a people who fought for self determination. Where regions were divided up with their resources.

On decolonization in South America and ind Africa uti pure deaths. We give country back how we got it. We have contracts for getting cocoa. We will keep that contract thank you very much. Push back in African charter is saying we reserve the right to define how we dispose of our resources.

What does it mean to have cultural distinctions. What does it mean to have cultural rights, to be a people. Are we looking back at the American anthropological association of 1947 saying that it is self evident that people are going to have different perspectives and different ways of governing it okay. The Soviet Union doctrine that allowed for Soviet Union stepping up to protect rights of peoples who are threatened by incursion of capitalist values. But if were talking about trying to see that there are different groups, different communities, different standards.

538 to 541 Mary engles piece. Is there a place for saying that there is culture that is static, culture that is fluid, but there is a should of a people.

The idea of saying we are trying to support the continuation of the German identity means that Germans are going to have different rights. The French are not going to understand German oktober fest.

For next week read from 545 (were supposed to do this today)

## Challenges to universalism – religion and dress

2023-04-11 Assignment Ten pp. 582-651.

Is it a problem that countries moved more towards religious regimes in for example Syria after 2011-2013. We also saw Egypt move towards religious control with the Muslim brotherhood. Some said this is democratic self-determination. Others said that this is discriminatory against people who don’t …

## Vertical Interpretation. International Human Rights Law Within States’ Legal and Political Orders

2023-04-18 Assignment Twelve pp. 1045-1105.

1917 Balfour declaration before Britain had any rights in Palestine. War ends agreement Britain gets mandate of Palestine. Britain has a responsibility to take care of territory until people who live there become civilized enough to take care of themselves.

Intratemporal law. We observe the law that was in effect at the time. Because law of discovery - law of conquest - created territories and states.

They said Palestinians should vote on what territory israel should have. Palestinians said no that’s crazy. This is our country. What do you mean vote of who should govern our country.

The question of what law can we apply now and how far back can you go to make reparations is not going to be applicable to this situation.

Bangladesh is another insane situation. Britain said hey let’s divide this up to be fair, and now we’ve divided it up, we’re outta here.

Right to self determination relies on the concept of a people. When you say you have a right to external self determination you can tell people to go away. Early 17th century analysis Hugo brothchess said if a people was being harmed they could call on another princely power - another principality - who was prepared to defend their rights, then the people could turn to that power to be protected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Peter Beinart

First question that comes up is question of definitions

1. Nationhood > goes to
2. Self-determination >
3. What is Zionism >
4. What does a Zionist state look like

The notion that Jews are people and not just a religious faith is deeply rooted in Jewish literature. When Jews read the Torah they read genesis a story of family > children of Israel > Israel being the name Jacob took at some point.

The eras of Jewish sovereignty end when Jesus born when temple destroyed around 7th century cd

For 20000 years or so Jewish people were people with a desire for country. Jewish interpretation is that god didn’t want Jews to have a country. When messiah comes Jews will have new temple and new country.

When empires crashing in 19th century - Ottoman Empire, other empires - some say we want a country - others such as Jews integrated into communities say no we will be German patriots we are Germans - some leftis groups going to Russia. In Europe Dreyfus affair for example shows that Jews are not necessarily going to be accepted as good workers or good Germans or good citizens of other nations.

Zionism says we can’t wait for the messiah. Our place is not in Europe. Our place is in the land of Israel. A lot of other Jews would have been happy to go to Uganda or wherever.

It’s not just a nationalist movement. Edward said observes that these movements emerge at the high tide of European colonialism. Essentially what happens is that the Jewish nationalist movement hitches its wagon to European imperialism. Most importantly they hitch their wagon onto the British empire where with the Balfour declarition the brits say yes we will give …

Zionist embraces many of the tropes of colonialism. These people need to be education. These people need to to be displaced is settler colonization. Zionism has many settler-colonial characteristics.

Now there is a strong movement to get countries like the us and other nations and CUNY to adopt the international Holocaust remembrance association definition of anti-semistism, which includes the right to the Jewish right to self-determination. This makes no senses

My - the problem

Another part of the definition of anti-semistism is making comparisons between Israel and nazi Germany.

Post Zionism meant that Zionism no longer had any relevance when state was created.

Einstein and Arendt said they believed in Zionism to the extent of Zionism. Peter beinart says that he is a cultural Zionist. The idea that …

Even if you had any …

Anti-Zionism for Palestinians is saying that Zionism is a colonial movement. Others say this should be an Islamic state. Muslim brotherhood tradition. Others say it should be a democratic secular state. Someone saying that there should be a secular Palestinian state where Palestine emcompasses Israeli Palestinians.

Do you see anything with demographics where there would be the potential for people to decide?

Divided societies - states that have more than one people are challenging. Beiart says that the best solution rather than binational (look at uk falling apart) should be partition.

If you look just inside the green line about 80 percent of the people are Jews. This is why partition was so appealing. There are some problems though
1. If there will be a Jewish supremacist state within the 1967 territory, there will still be 20 percent of Jews outside the 1967 (93 percent of land in 1967 territory is owned by state - this land is leased - the Israel land authority has as purpose to promote Jewish land possession) What would happen to jewish settlers living in the West Bank? More action takes place in West Bank - Judaea and Somalia -
2. Is partition possible? Infrastructure.

Binational state: binational states are more violent when one group is locked out. When a right to vote is given, armed resistance often disarm. Sinn Fein. African national congress. FARC.

Generational shift: one one side we have to end colonialism. On the other side conservatism colonizing.

Price tag situation. Settlers who were being pushed out of settlements by israeli state. If israeli

Irha definition of anti-semitism is crafted to fulfill a political function. It is actually extremely dangerous. In India you are beginning to see the language used to describe anti-Hinduism as anti-modi state.

If you are saying that all Palestinians are anti-semites because they want to live in a country where they are treated equally (anti-Zionism). It is an exercise in anti-palestinianism - it is very successful. The Biden administration ...
