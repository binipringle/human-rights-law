## Facts

As previously noted, Yogi Adityanath’s Hindu Youth Brigade promotes Hindutva through, among other acts, reconverting Muslims/Christians to Hinduism, preventing relationships between Hindu girls and Muslim boys, and the protection of cows.

On September 28, 2015, members of a Hindu temple in Bidasa, Uttar Pradesh announced over temple loudspeakers that a local Muslim man (Mohammed Ikhlaq): (1) had killed cows (sacred in Hinduism, and protected under the Indian Constitution), (2) had left cow remains at an electrical transformer on a central street near his home, and (3) had cow meat in his refrigerator. Although those acts would be subject to up to seven-years’ imprisonment if reported to the police, a group of men who were members of “Save the Cow,” a subset of the Hindu Youth Brigade, went to the home of Mr. Ikhlaq to confront him.

The men beat him over the head with a sewing machine, dragged him down 14 cement steps, and left him dying at the electrical transformer in the street in front of his home. They beat other members of the Ikhlaq family, bashing the skull of Mr. Ikhlaq’s son with a brick, and leaving him in critical condition. According to Mrs. Ikhlaq, some among the Save the Cow vigilantes had screamed, “Kill them,” on entering the Ikhlaq home. Police later stated that there was no evidence of any animal remains being left in a public space, and that the meat found in the Ikhlaq home was goat, and not cow. Those arrested for Mr. Ikhlaq’s murder included the son of a BJP politician; all were members of the Hindu Youth Brigade’s “Save the Cow” subdivision. A local leader of the Hindu Youth Brigade noted that Mr. Ikhlaq had encouraged any harm to himself by killing a cow, and that his death was accidental – things happen when a mob is angry, and no one in the mob is to blame if Mr. Ikhlaq fell while being jostled; they only intended to slap him around.

In May 2016, a new report was issued saying that the meat that had proven under testing in October to be goat was, in fact, cow. Yogi Adityanath called on the government of Uttar Pradesh to recognize its mistake, and release the 16 young men arrested for murder, as they had “done nothing wrong.” Yogi Adityanath also called for any funds that had been given to the Ikhlaq family to be withdrawn.

In March 2017, after the BJP had won 308 of the 403 parliamentary seats in Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister of India (Narendra Modi) named Yogi Adityanath Chief Minister (the equivalent of governor) of Uttar Pradesh. Leaders of the Hindu Youth Brigade stated that they would be freer to engage in their work with Yogi Adityanath in charge. After a young couple was “roughed up” by a crowd for involvement in love jihad in early April 2017, Yogi Adityanath asked leaders within the Hindu Youth Brigade to report matters to the police, stating that the police would no longer ignore Hindu concerns, but support them.

## Human rights issues

As legal advisor for a group of human rights organizations in Uttar Pradesh, India, there are several human rights issues that I could raise for the international review of India's human rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). I have been asked to raise specific concerns related to the government of Uttar Pradesh, particularly under the leadership of its Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, since March 2017.

The government of Uttar Pradesh has failed to protect the human rights of religious minorities, particularly Muslims. As signatory to the ICCPR, ICESCR, and CERD, India is obligated to protect the human rights of religious minorities under the ICCPR, ICESCR, and CERD.

### Right to Life

The government of India/Uttar Pradesh's failure to prosecute/release of the 16 members of the Hindu Youth Brigade who murdered Ikhlaq violates Ikhlaq's right to life. As signatory to the ICCPR, India has an obligation to protect the right to life of all individuals within its jurisdiction.

Article 6(1) of the ICCPR states "[e]very human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life." The right to life is a *jus cogens* norm, described as "the supreme right of the human being."

Here, Ikhlaq was arbitrarily deprived of his right to life. Ikhlaq's deprivation of his right to life was arbitrary because it was carried out without due process of law and in violation of his human rights. Ikhlaq was attacked by a group of men who were members of the Hindu Youth Brigade's "Save the Cow" subdivision, who accused him of killing cows and consuming beef, a crime that is protected under the Indian Constitution.

The murder of Ikhlaq was arbitrary because it was carried out without any legal justification or authority. The allegation that led to Ikhlaq's death - that Ikhlaq had violated Indian constitutional law by killing a cow or cows - were publicly communicated to people gathered at a Hindu temple in Bidasa, Uttar Pradesh, by members of the temple, over temple loudspeakers. Ihlaq's alleged acts were not reported to the police nor investigated by the police. Instead, a group of men who were members of “Save the Cow,” a subset of the Hindu Youth Brigade, went to the home of Mr. Ikhlaq to confront him. Therefore, Ikhlaq's deprivation of life was arbitrary because Ikhlaq had no opportunity to defend himself against the allegations.  

India and Uttar Pradesh further violated Article 6(1) of the ICCPR by failing to protect Ikhlaq's right to life by law. The question of whether Ikhlaq had cow meat or goat meat in his refrigerator is irrelevant, because the Hindu Youth Brigade's "Save the Cow" subdivision had no authority to take Indian law into their own hands. The Indian government failed to protect Ikhlaq's human rights by releasing the 16 members of the Hindu Youth Brigade who murdered Ikhlaq and declaring that these 16 young men "had done nothing wrong." When in April 2017 Yogi Adityanath asked leaders within the Hindu Youth Brigade to report matters such as involvements in the love jihad to the police and stated that the police would "no longer ignore Hindu concerns, but support them," the government of India newly failed to protect Muslims from potential attacks by the Hindu Youth Brigade.

In conclusion, Ikhlaq's inherent right to life was violated because Ikhlaq was killed illegally as a result of accusations that he had broken Indian law but which he had no opportunity to deny because the accusations were made without due process of law.

### Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment

The beating of Mohammed Ikhlaq, the bashing of his son's skull with a brick, and the violence committed against other members of the Ikhlaq family may constitute torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. India has an obligation under the ICCPR to prohibit and prevent such acts.

Article 7 of the ICCPR states "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."

Article 5(b) of CERD protects "The right to security of person and protection by the State against violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted by government officials or by any individual group or institution."

Here, "The men beat him over the head with a sewing machine, dragged him down 14 cement steps, and left him dying at the electrical transformer in the street in front of his home. They beat other members of the Ikhlaq family, bashing the skull of Mr. Ikhlaq’s son with a brick, and leaving him in critical condition. According to Mrs. Ikhlaq, some among the Save the Cow vigilantes had screamed, “Kill them,” on entering the Ikhlaq home. Police later stated that there was no evidence of any animal remains being left in a public space, and that the meat found in the Ikhlaq home was goat, and not cow. Those arrested for Mr. Ikhlaq’s murder included the son of a BJP politician; all were members of the Hindu Youth Brigade’s “Save the Cow” subdivision. A local leader of the Hindu Youth Brigade noted that Mr. Ikhlaq had encouraged any harm to himself by killing a cow, and that his death was accidental – things happen when a mob is angry, and no one in the mob is to blame if Mr. Ikhlaq fell while being jostled; they only intended to slap him around."

### Freedom of thought, conscience and religion

India has an obligation under the ICCPR to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.

Article 18 of the ICCPR states "(1) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching. (2) No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice. (3) Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. (4) The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and, when applicable, legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions."

Here, the government of Uttar Pradesh failed to protect Mohammad Ikhlaq's right to freedom to adopt a religion or belief of his choice by promoting Hindutva and supporting the Hindu Youth Brigade, despite knowing that the Hindu Youth Brigade targeted Muslims.

The government of India violated Ikhlaq's human rights by sanctioning the 16 young men's murder of Ikhlaq. When "In May 2016, a new report was issued saying that the meat that had proven under testing in October to be goat was, in fact, cow. Yogi Adityanath called on the government of Uttar Pradesh to recognize its mistake, and release the 16 young men arrested for murder, as they had 'done nothing wrong.' Yogi Adityanath also called for any funds that had been given to the Ikhlaq family to be withdrawn." Here, the Indian government is effectively saying that freedom to eat cow as part of religious belief is limited under Article 18(3) of the ICCPR - and that this eating of cow justified Hindu Youth Brigade's attack on Ikhlaq - because Ikhlaq had cow meat and not goat meat in his refrigerator, so the Article 18(3) limitation on Ikhlaq's right to freedom to manifest his religion did not extend to the right to manifest his religion by killing cows. In other words, Ikhlaq's right to freedom of religion did not give him a right to eat cow, and, when he ate cow, he was not protected under ICCPR.

This does not justify vigilanteism. The murder of Mohammed Ikhlaq and the subsequent release of members of the Hindu Youth Brigade's "Save the Cow" subdivision, who were allegedly involved in the attack, is a clear example of the government's failure to protect the rights of minorities.

More broadly, the Hindu Youth Brigade's efforts to prevent relationships between Hindus and Muslims, as well as their reconversion of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism, raise concerns about freedom of religion.

### Right to non-discrimination

A claim can be made that India and Uttar Pradesh failed to protect Ikhlaq's right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of religion.

India ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in 1968. Under Article 5 of this convention, "States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: [...] (d) Other civil rights, in particular: [...] (vii) The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion;

Here, The targeting of Muslims by the Hindu Youth Brigade's "Save the Cow" subdivision raises concerns about discrimination on the basis of religion.

### Equal access to justice

Under Article 5 of CERD, "States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: (a) The right to equal treatment before the tribunals and all other organs administering justice;

The fact that Yogi Adityanath called for the release of the 16 young men arrested for Mohammed Ikhlaq's murder, despite evidence to the contrary, raises concerns about access to justice. India has an obligation under the ICCPR to ensure that all individuals have access to an effective remedy for violations of their human rights.
