<!--## Historical Background

When the British left India in mid-August 1947, they split the territory into Pakistan (a Muslim territory to the northeast (in what is today Bangladesh), and in the west, in what is today Pakistan), and India. Those who had been seeking to have Britain leave India had varying views of what the country should look like: some wanted a secular country, free of colonial powers; others wanted protections for the large Muslim minority that had had some degree of protection under British control; others wished for a country based in religious and cultural majoritarianism – a country based in the Hindutva, or Hinduness, of its people. The period of India’s partition into Pakistan and India (“Partition”) saw communal violence, particularly between Hindus and Muslims.

One believer in Hindutva at the time of Partition was the head priest (The leader - or “Mahant” - of the Gorakhnath temple was Digvijay Nath)  of the Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur (in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with over 240 million people). In fact, angered at what he saw as appeasement of Muslims in a secular government, he called on his followers to assassinate Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi on January 27, 1948, three days before a group of his followers completed the assassination.

In 1949, that same leader called on Hindus to place statues of Hindu gods in a mosque (the Babri Masjid) in Ayodhya, claiming that the mosque was an affront to Hinduism, having been built in the 16th Century CE at, what is according to that Hindu priest, the birthplace and holy site of King Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu that had lived in that area around 1000 BCE. Over the course of the next forty-three years, first that leader then his successor (Mahant Avaidyanath succeeded Digvijay Nath, leading the temple from 1969-2014), called for the destruction of the Babri Masjid, and the introduction of a temple honoring Rama. Both of the head priests of the Gorakhnath temple were also deeply involved in Indian politics, with the successor becoming a member of parliament in 1989, and joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (the “BJP,” perceived to be an anti-incumbent, Hindu-nationalist party) when running again to represent Gorakhpur in 1991.

After winning again in 1991, another push was made to destroy the Babri Masjid – a Hindu mob led by the head priest of the Gorakhnath temple destroyed the Mosque on December 6, 1992. Among the followers of the head priest who stood out for his devotion and charisma was a 20-year old who later came to be known as Yogi Adityanath. In 1994, at age 22, Yogi Adityanath was recognized as the chosen successor as the next head priest of the Gorakhnath temple. In 1998, at age 26, Yogi Adityanath was elected as the member of parliament representing Gorakhpur, running as a member of the BJP.

In 2002, Yogi Adityanath formed the Hindu Yuva Vahini (Hindu Youth Brigade). He calls for unity of those religions derived from Hinduism (including Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism), and rejection of “atrocities” committed against Hindus, particularly by those following foreign religions – mostly Muslims and Christians. The organization is best known for “reconverting” people from Islam/Christianity to Hinduism (“ghar wapsi”), preventing Hindu girls from being in relations with Muslim boys and potentially converting to Islam (“love jihad”), and the punishment of those who harm cows (“Save the Cow”). In 2007, Yogi Adityanath was arrested and spent 15 days in jail for inciting communal violence leading to two deaths; one of the cases arising from that violence was and has two on-going cases (the court system in India is slower than the court system in the United States).
In 2009, Yogi Adityanath reportedly stated that for each Hindu girl Muslims took (through conversion), his followers would take 100 Muslim girls. For each Hindu killed, his followers would kill 100 Muslims – “We will do whatever they do 100 fold, with interest.” In 2014, Yogi Adityanath gained greater fame, becoming the head priest of the Gorakhnath temple (a position he still holds) at the death of his “spiritual father,” the head priest before him. In February 2015, noting that Muslim mosques sat near Hindu holy sites, Yogi Adityanath said, “if that’s how it is, give us permission, we will install Gauri, Ganesh and Nandi [Hindu gods] in every mosque.” He went on to say, “this is the century of Hindutva, not just in India, but in the entire world,” calling for equal rights for Hindus.

Some noted that his statements were problematic in part because of his political party, the BJP, coming to power in 2014. For example, some Muslim groups in India asked that school children not have to perform Surya Namaskar (a morning stretch that is sometimes referred to as a Sun salutation) on June 21, 2015, because it could be construed as a prayer to Surya, the Sun god (It might be noted that the United Nations recognized an [“International Day of Yoga”](https://www.un.org/en/observances/yoga-day) at the request of Prime Minister Modi’s government in 2014). Yogi Adityanath argued that the Sun god gave his power to all, regardless of caste, creed, or religion – if they wished to not recognize the Sun, “they should drown themselves in the sea, or stay in some dark cell.”
