<!--## Facts

Leaders of the Congress Party in Uttar Pradesh have noted that Yogi Adityanath had a number of cases pending against him when he became Chief Minister. In dismissing one hate speech case against the Chief Minister, the High Court (similar to a U.S. State Supreme Court) noted that the resources of the petitioner, an individual who had kept the case going for fourteen years should be investigated, and fined the petitioner 100,000 Rupees.

In Uttar Pradesh, assaults against journalists have risen, and a number of journalists who have challenged government claims have had complaints (“First Information Reports”) issued against them, forcing some to engage in legal processes for years to clear their names. A whistleblower informed a reporter that the federally-mandated midday-meal-scheme, providing “nutritious meals” to children, was providing children in his (largely Muslim) village with only bread (rotis) and salt; after the reporter published video of the food distribution, the whistleblower was arrested and held for more than three years. Another journalist was held for several weeks on suspicion of butchering a cow, with no evidence or witness tying him to any violence against cows, but allowing the government to seize his computer.

Although communal rioting (based on differences in religion or caste) has dropped greatly since 2017, Hindu-nationalist hate speech has increased, and governmental protections have decreased for those perceived to undermine the strength of the government. This has raised concerns that Yogi Adityanath continues to call for extra-judicial violence and executions, but without concern for parameters that might otherwise be imposed by either the judiciary or another rule of law mechanism. There is a concern that the actions in Uttar Pradesh stand as examples of the direction nationalism may take throughout India, and that Prime Minister Modi is looking to Yogi Adityanath as a potential successor.

## Human rights issues

As legal advisor for a group of human rights organizations in Uttar Pradesh, India, I have identified some of the human rights issues that can be raised for the international review of India's human rights obligations under the ICCPR, ICESCR, and CERD, specifically related to the government of Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of its Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath since March 2017. These issues are listed below.

## Freedom of expression and the press

The government of Uttar Pradesh failed to protect the right to freedom of expression and the press of journalists in Uttar Pradesh when it issued complaints (“First Information Reports” or "FIR") against journalists who had challenged government claims, detained a reporter who critiqued a children's food program, and detained another journalist without cause and seized his computer. India is a signatory to the ICCPR.

Article 19 of the the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that "(1)Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. (2) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. (3) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article [article 19] carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary (a) for respect of the rights or reputations of others; and/or (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals."

The freedoms of opinion and expression are independent but coexist as adjuvants. Freedom of expression depends on the anterior right to hold an opinion, which in turn is shaped by others exercising their right to impart information and ideas. The freedoms of opinion and expression facilitate enquiry and the dissemination of information of every kind, through all conceivable media, as well as the propagation of political and other perspectives, and scrutiny and accountability of State institutions. They depend on conditions which support a multiplicity of influences on opinion, especially through mass media channels. They are personal freedoms, but are also cardinal to the proper functioning of democracy, free participation in public affairs and accountability of those wielding power.

## Freedom from arbitrary detention

The detention of journalists and others without proper evidence or due process violates the right to freedom from arbitrary detention under Article 9 of the ICCPR.

Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that "(1) Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. (2) Anyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him. (3) Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release. It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody, but release may be subject to guarantees to appear for trial, at any other stage of the judicial proceedings, and, should occasion arise, for execution of the judgement. (4) Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful. (5) Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation."

## Due process

The government of Uttar Pradesh violated journalists' right to due process by using complaints and arrests to silence dissenting voices in Uttar Pradesh.

Article 14 (3)(a) of the the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that everyone shall be entitled to be informed promptly and in detail [...] of the nature and cause of the charge against him. Article 14 (3)(c) entitles everyone to be tried without undue delay, and Article 14 (3)(e) entitles everyone to examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him.

## Equal treatment under law

The government of Uttar Pradesh violated the right to equal treatment under the law under Article 14 of the ICCPR by dismissing a hate speech case against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath without proper investigation.

Article 14 (1) of the ICCPR provides that "all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals [and] everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice;"

Here, ... Dismissing a case without proper investigation undermines the right to a fair hearing and undermines the principle of equal treatment under the law.

According to the Times of India, Yogi Adityanath had 27 cases against him before he became Chief Minister of the State of Uttar Pradesh. "Congress leader BK Hariprasad on April 16, condemned the law of Uttar Pradesh. He also said that Yogi Adityanath had 27 cases against him before becoming CM. While speaking to ANI, BK Hariprasad said, “There is no such thing as law in Uttar Pradesh. There were 27 cases against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath before he became CM. If there was a criminal case against Atiq Ahmed, there were also cases against Yogi. But Yogi became CM. This is not only bad for Uttar Pradesh but for the whole country.” ["CM Yogi had 27 cases against him before he became CM."

## ne bis in idem

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) recognizes the principle of "ne bis in idem," which means that no one shall be tried or punished again for an offense for which they have already been finally convicted or acquitted.

Article 14(7) of the ICCPR states that "No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offense for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country." This principle is also recognized in other international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

The fact pattern for the final exam linked to a February 20, 2023 article in the Decca Herald about how the Allahabad High Court imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on a man for filing repeated petitions against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath regarding the 2007 Gorakhpur riot case in spite of the issue allegedly being settled by the Supreme Court. ["HC fines man Rs 1 lakh for repeated pleas against Yogi in Gorakhpur riots case"](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hc-fines-man-rs-1-lakh-for-repeated-pleas-against-yogi-in-gorakhpur-riots-case-1193979.html)

## Protection of minorities

The government's failure to protect minorities, including religious and ethnic minorities, from hate speech and violence by Hindu nationalist groups violates the right to non-discrimination and protection of minorities under Article 2 and Article 27 of the ICCPR and Article 2 of the CERD.

Article 2 of the ICCPR provides that "(1) Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. (2) [...] each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take the necessary steps [...] to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the [ICCPR] [...] [3] Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes (a) To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity;(b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy;(c) To ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted."

Article 27 of the ICCPR provides that "In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language."

Article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) requires States Parties to the Convention to take effective measures to prevent, prohibit and eradicate racial discrimination, both direct and indirect, in all its forms. This includes measures to prevent and eliminate racial segregation and apartheid, to promote understanding and tolerance among racial and ethnic groups, and to promote the full and equal participation of all persons in economic, social, cultural and political life, regardless of their race, ethnicity or national origin. States Parties are also required to guarantee the right to effective remedies for victims of racial discrimination, including access to justice and adequate reparations. The article applies to all areas of public life, including employment, education, housing, health care, and access to public services.

## Right to food

The denial of nutritious meals to children under the federally-mandated midday-meal scheme and the arrest of whistleblowers who expose such violations violates the right to food under Article 11 of the ICESCR.

Article 11 of the ICESCR provides that "(1) The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. The States Parties will take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this effect the essential importance of international co-operation based on free consent. (2) The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed (a) To improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most efficient development and utilization of natural resources; (b) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need."
